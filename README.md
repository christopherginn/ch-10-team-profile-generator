  ## Installation
  Team Generator requires the use of Node.js. After installing Node.js, you must install the node module: Inquirer.

  ***

  ## Usage

  Team Generator uses prompts from Inquirer to easily collect information about your different team mates or peers. 
  
  After running `index.js` and selecting that you do not have anymore employees to add, a HTML file will be created in the dist/ folder that will display a cleaner presention based off the information you entered.

  The generated HTML file will be called `employees.html`.
